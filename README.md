# **Mapping_Earthquakes**

## Overview of the analysis:
Build insightful visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. The map will offer a view of all the earthquakes around the world with a magnitude greater than 4.5. The project will be presented on three maps. 

### Resources

Software: VS Code, Javascript, JSON D3, GeoJSON and Leaflet. 

Data: Found on the main branch of this repository [Mapping_Earthquakes](https://github.com/chocoplace/Mapping_Earthquakes).

## Basic Project Plan According to the module
- Purpose: The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
- Tasks: To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.
- Approach: Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
Now that you have an overview of the project plan, let's set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps.

## Results
An insightful map with interactive features and live data.
